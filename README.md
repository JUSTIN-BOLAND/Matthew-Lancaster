C:\SCRIPTOR GITHUB\README _ Public Domain Ownership & Education Share-er.md

Hi There Everyone Coder GitHub and Elsewhere

Just a Few Word on Public Domain

At GitHub If I Set Any Ownership Rights License
and Publish in Public the Free of Cost Mode for Github

That Would Mean all Ownership Rights Are Set That Commercial Usage is Allowed
While That is Not a Benefit for My Worker 
I Would Like to Be Contacted For My Hitt Counter Result

While on the Other Hand
It Hard to Talker that any Configuration of Code
Can Be a Mirror Print of Someone Has Done Before

While I Take the Stance that My Code Might Include Somebody Else Work
That is another Reason for Use the Public & License Name Unlicensed

If it Were Set to Nothing and then It would Be a Copy Right Over Again

I Did Read all this Before I Began it Here in Github

This was the Best Option after Reading Somebody
Recommending Github

While I was Look for Option to Show Off My Code
And It Very Difficult to Hold a Website and Then Allow to View Code 
Without It Talking this Document Unable to Be Display as Text
And Download Option is there Instead

Is Only for Education at the End of the Day
I Get Enjoyment from It And Hope You Will

I Shall Look to Include Some Visual Basic 6 Projects Also
When I Get Time Look in the Area of Folder
This is My Script Folder While Editor Mode Sort them Out
I Class VB6 Different from them in another Folder
As Originally Were Working on them before My Scripter Folder Came along
And My Scriptor Folder Include Quite a Bit on VBS VBScript

Include My Camera Reel Roll Up-Loader
Which is Quite Nice a Used a Lot
None Sync Programs Get You Camera Reel Off-Loader as Nicely

And Pin Items to Task Bar For Windows 10 Another Good One

Lots There What I Find Constructive to User of a Dozy Computer

My Code Style is a Bit Shaky and Rem Line Do Some Explain
But Many Project I Use All the Time and Work Perfectly

Not Sure What Update GitHub Will Look This is My 1st
Nice to Have Somewhere Updater Good
The Site Of My Page Is to Show Off Code to My Friend Base Mainly
I Don't Really Want Any Improvement Done to the code Without Asking

I'm a Bit Weak at 50 Nearly Knocking on that Door 1968
And Had a Broken Clavicle Bone From Damage Bike Riding Most of My Learn 
I Know It Is Bleeding Heart on the Internet 
And Then What Else Do I Talk

Yours Kindly
~
