Hi Everyone Coder at GitHub and Elsewhere Viewing Today

Site Offering on Education and Share-er

One word on public domain
At Github if I set any type of ownership rights license
And publish in public the free of cost mode for Github

That would mean all ownership rights are set that commercial usage is allowed
While that is not a benefit for my worker 
I would like to be contacted somewhere with the Hitt counter result

While on the other hand rights
It hard to talker that any configuration of code
Be a mirror print of someone has done before

While I take the stance that my code might include somebody else work
And always credit due
That is another reason for use the public domain & license name unlicensed

If any work I included by another I will have their agenda about copy rights to Readme.txt

If it were set to nothing and then it would be copyright all over again
By way of not giving consent I reckon

I did read all this about rights while starting here in Github

This was the best option after long reading somebody recommending Github
And wish somewhere to host code proper

Is only for education not making money
I get enjoyment from it and hope you will as a hobbyist
Or benefit as long as you give me credit learn

I shall look to include some large amount visual basic 6 projects also
When I get time another folder
This is my edited script folder 

Codes include
Include my camera reel roll up-loader
Which is quite nice a used a lot
None sync programs get you camera reel off-loader as nicely with date marking

And pin items to task bar for windows 10 another good one mine and another person main part code working

My code style is a bit of a sod with rem line do some explain
Many project I use all the time and work perfectly

Nice to have Github to show off at last with updater 
The site of my page is to show off my code to my contacts base mainly
I'm not really looking for code improvements by other people without asking

I'm a bit weak for coding at 50 nearly knocking on that door 1968
And had a broken clavicle bone from damage bike riding most of my learn 
I know it is bleeding heart on the Internet 
And then what else do I talk

Took a While to Get Familiarize With GitHub Done Not Been Alseep and Allnighter

A Well Worth While Allnighter it was to I been dreamer of this one for a long time.
