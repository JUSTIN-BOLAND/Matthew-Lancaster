Tidal Requires the Speech Program From Microsoft Called SAPI4 
The One Before SAPI5 Currently 
You are Able to Install Both They Use Different Command Set

This was a Favorite Project 
To Display a Digital Number of % in Relation to How High or Low the Tide
Was 
On Measuring for a Year
I Picked the Wave Form High and Low So Would Be Correct for Amount of Up and Down High Low
For One Year 
But Never Worked Out that Way
as Large Incorrect During the Year
But a Rough Example Of What Speed It Moves At

I Found Later
That Tidal Measurement was Discovered after 17 Years of Reading were Taken 
It was Found there was a Pattern Repeater

and Another Thing was When the Moon Is Over Head the Tidal Will Be High 7 Hours Later 
From the Pull Force of Gravity
